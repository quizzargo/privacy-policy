    <h1>Privacy Policy — Quizzar Go</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong><!-- Insert date -->October 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Quizzar Go ("we", "us", "the App") is an educational quiz generator and learning tool. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the Quizzar Go mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class="notice">
      <p><strong>Short version:</strong> We do not sell your personal data. The app may send prompts or content you provide to third-party AI services (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI) to generate quiz content or chat responses. We use Firebase for optional features and analytics, and we show ads via an ad network. You can contact us at <a href="mailto:quizzargo@gmail.com">quizzargo@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>User-provided information</h3>
    <p>You may choose to type questions, prompts, or quiz titles in the app. This text is used to generate responses and to store local copies of quizzes if you save them. If you upload images (for multimodal features), those images may be sent to AI services to process the request.</p>

    <h3>Automatically collected information</h3>
    <p>We collect minimal device and usage data necessary to run and improve the app, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crash reports and basic diagnostics (Firebase Crashlytics — optional)</li>
      <li>Anonymous analytics (how features are used)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Local storage</h3>
    <p>Saved quizzes and chat history are stored on your device using local storage (e.g., Hive). We do not upload saved quizzes to our servers unless you explicitly choose an upload feature.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To generate quiz content and chat replies using third-party AI services.</li>
      <li>To persist saved quizzes and recent chats locally for your convenience.</li>
      <li>To monitor performance and crashes and to improve the app.</li>
      <li>To serve ads if you opt into Rewarded Ads; ads are served by external ad networks and follow their privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses the following third-party services. Each has its own privacy practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI providers:</strong> Google Gemini and/or OpenAI for text and multimodal generation. Prompts and images you submit are sent to those services and processed according to their policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> optional services for remote config, analytics, and crash reporting (if enabled).</li>
      <li><strong>Ad networks:</strong> if you view or interact with ads, data needed to deliver ads may be shared with ad providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Saved quizzes and chat history remain on your device until you delete them. Crash and analytics data retained by third parties follow those providers’ retention rules.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent and believe your child provided personal information through the app, contact us and we will remove it where possible.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect stored local data and transmissions to third parties. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure — please avoid sharing very sensitive personal information in prompts.</p>

    <h2>Opt-Outs and Choices</h2>
    <p>You may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear local saved data within the app.</li>
      <li>Disable optional analytics or crash reporting (if provided in settings).</li>
      <li>Opt-out of personalized ads by following the ad provider’s instructions (ad networks provide controls).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy occasionally. We’ll post the updated date at the top of this page. Significant changes will be communicated inside the app where feasible.</p>
