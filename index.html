    <h1>Privacy Policy — Quizzar Go</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong>October 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Quizzar Go ("we", "us", "the App") is an educational quiz generator and AI learning tool. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the Quizzar Go mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class="notice">
      <p><strong>Short version:</strong> Quizzar Go does not sell or share your personal data. The app may send text or image prompts you provide to trusted AI services (Google Gemini or OpenAI) to generate quiz content. Optional analytics and crash reports may be collected to improve performance. You can contact us at <a href="mailto:quizzargo@gmail.com">quizzargo@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1. User-provided information</h3>
    <p>When you type prompts, quiz titles, or chat messages, that text is used to generate content and may be temporarily transmitted to AI services. If you use multimodal features (e.g., image-based input), images are processed by the AI provider only for that request.</p>

    <h3>2. Automatically collected information</h3>
    <p>The app may collect limited technical data through Firebase services, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crash reports and basic diagnostics (via Firebase Crashlytics — optional)</li>
      <li>Anonymous feature usage (Firebase Analytics — optional)</li>
      <li>Remote configuration fetches for app settings and key rotation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Local storage</h3>
    <p>All saved quizzes, preferences, and chat history are stored locally on your device using secure app storage (Hive or SharedPreferences). The app does <strong>not</strong> access your photos, media, or external files.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To generate quizzes and AI responses through trusted AI APIs</li>
      <li>To store your quizzes and progress locally for convenience</li>
      <li>To analyze app performance and fix bugs (if Crashlytics/Analytics is enabled)</li>
      <li>To deliver rewarded ads or in-app ads using third-party ad networks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use third-party providers to offer essential features. Each service has its own privacy practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI Providers:</strong> Google Gemini and OpenAI — used for generating quiz or chat responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> Remote Config, Crashlytics, and Analytics — used for diagnostics and configuration.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad Networks:</strong> Google AdMob — displays ads and rewarded ads following their privacy terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Local data (quizzes, chats, preferences) stays on your device until you delete it. Analytics and crash data are retained by Firebase according to their retention schedules. We do not store or host user-generated content on our own servers.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The app is designed for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe your child has submitted data through the app, contact us for assistance in removal.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use secure APIs and rely on trusted third-party services to handle limited data. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, so we recommend not sharing sensitive personal information in prompts or chat messages.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can clear all saved data from within the app.</li>
      <li>You can disable analytics or crash reporting (if the app settings provide that option).</li>
      <li>You can manage ad personalization through Google’s ad settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or services. The date above will always indicate the most recent revision.</p>
